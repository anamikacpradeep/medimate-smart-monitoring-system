**System Architecture:**  
The frontend is a React single‑page app served from static hosting
(Vercel).  It communicates with an Express/Node.js backend via REST
endpoints (`/api/*`).  The backend stores schedules and history in a
MongoDB (or any chosen database) and uses `nodemailer`/SMS API to send
alerts to guardians when a dose is missed.
